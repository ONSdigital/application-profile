Under certain circumstances, some people are able to claim both contribution-based Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance and Universal Credit at the same time. We do not currently have timely enough information to identify these individuals prior to producing the Claimant Count. Consequently, there has been a small amount of double counting. Information from DWP suggests this double counting increased at the start of the pandemic and has stabilised at approximately 1.0 to 1.5% of the Claimant Count. We will monitor this rate and provide further updates if the rate shifts outside of these boundaries.",
